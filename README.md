# resvn
#### Run SVN commands on multiple repositories

[![GoDoc][docimg]][docurl] [![Go Report Card][repimg]][repurl]

```
github.com/ardnew/resvn 0.11.1 darwin-arm64 main@9ddb938 2024-11-18T19:41:24Z

USAGE
  resvn [flags] [match ...] [! ignore ...] [-- command ...]

FLAGS (mnemonics shown in [brackets])
  -L path        use file path contents as [login] arguments
                 {"/Users/foo/.svnauth"}
  -S url         use [server] url to construct REST API queries
                 {"http://svn.host:3343"}
  -a arg         append each [argument] arg to all SVN commands
  -c             use [case]-sensitive matching
  -d             print commands which would be executed ([dry-run])
  -f path        use repository definitions from [file] path
                 {"/Users/foo/.svnrepo"}
  -l user:pass   use user:pass to authenticate with SVN or REST API ([login])
  -o             use logical-[or] matching if multiple patterns given
  -q             suppress all non-essential and error messages ([quiet])
  -s url         use [server] url to construct all URLs
                 {"http://svn.host:3690"}
  -u             [update] cached repository definitions from server
  -w             construct [web] URLs instead of repository URLs

NOTES
  The default server URL prefix is defined with environment variable $RESVN_URL
  and used when flag "-s" is unspecified. The default REST API URL prefix is
  defined with environment variable $RESVN_API and used when flag "-S" is
  unspecified. The REST API is optional because it is only used for automatic
  generation of the known SVN repository cache (otherwise given with flag "-f").
  URLs may include both protocol and port, e.g., "http://server.com:3690".

  All arguments following the first occurrence of "--" are forwarded (in the
  same order they were given) to each "svn" command generated. Since the same
  command may run with multiple repositories, placeholder variables may be used
  in the given command line, which are then substituted with attributes from the
  target repository each time the "svn" command is run.

      @ = repository URL (must be first character in word)
      ^ = repository base name
      & = preceding URL/path argument
      $ = last path component (basename) of "&"
      ! = parent path component (basename of dirname) of "&"

  For example, exporting a common tag from all repositories with "DAPA" in the
  name (excluding any that match "Calc" or "DIOS") into respectively-named
  subdirectories of the current directory:

      % resvn DAPA ! Calc DIOS -- export @/tags/foo ./^/tags/foo

  Besides the invoked subcommand's options, the "svn" command also recognizes
  several global options that are applicable to all subcommands. Shown below,
  these can be provided via environment variable or via command-line flag. If
  both are provided, the command-line flag takes precedence. Multiple global
  options can be expressed in a single command-line flag's argument or by
  providing the command-line flag multiple times. The following examples are all
  functionally equivalent:

      % resvn -a "--username=foo --password=bar"
      % resvn -a "--username=foo" -a "--password=bar"
      % RESVN_ARG="--username=foo --password=bar" resvn

  The global options are "--force-interactive", by default. If either
  environment variable or command-line flag are provided, they will take
  precedence and omit the default option(s).

```

# Usage

First, please read the command-line usage reference that is output with the help flag `-h` (also copied above).

### Update repository cache

`resvn` operates primarily with a plain-text file, or cache, that defines all known repositories. The format of this file is simply one repository name per line. Each line should be the repository base name *only* (not a full URL). For example, a repository at URL `http://svn.host:3690/svn/Team` would be represented by a single line containing only `Team`. The full URL is generated by `resvn` using a combination of these repository names, the server URL prefix given with flag `-s` (or the default URL from environment variable `$RESVN_URL`), and the presence of flag `-w`.

Instead of creating and maintaining this cache manually, `resvn` is capable of requesting a list of all repositories from the SVN server and updating the cache automatically. When called with flag `-u`, and optionally flag `-l` if SVN credentials are not cached locally, the SVN server REST API is queried and results are written to a cache file in your current directory, overwriting any that already exists. You can copy this repository cache to your ${HOME} directory, and it will be used as the default cache when calling `resvn` without flag `-f`.
